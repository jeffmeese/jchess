=======================
A simple chess program I'm developing for my own amusement.

Board Representations
=====================
Currently, I have a couple different board representations. I have an 0x88 board and a standard 8x8 board. Next on the docket is bitboards. I've set it up so that changing board representations is very simple. See the board.h file to see how it's done.

Move Generation
===============
Currently, pseudo-legal move generation is used. I may eventually move to a legal move generator but this works for now. 

Search Functions
================
I'm going to start with a NegaMax search. Next an alpha-beta search will be implemented. Once these are complete, I'll move on to things like iterative deepening and transposition tables.

Evaluation Functions
====================
At first a simple piece weight evaluation function will be used. I haven't done a lot of research on evaluation so I'll defer planning more until I get more knowledge on the subject.
